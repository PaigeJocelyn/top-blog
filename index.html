        <h1>^___^ Welcome to Paige's Kawaii The Odin Project Blog! ^___^</h1>

        <h2>~Some Personal Background~</h2>
        <p><strong>My name is Paige. I am a 35 year old wife, mom, and proud trans woman.</strong> 
        I grew up on the north shore of MA with my mother, grandmother, aunt and cousins. I dropped 
        out of highschool, got my GED and ran away from home at age 16 to move in with my future wife. I spent 
        the next sixteen years developing a lucrative sales career and starting a family. The highlight 
        of this part of my professional life was working for 5 years in business finance sales at an 
        inc 5000 start up. There I helped create the culture, earned over six figures, and made president's 
        club while being the floor manager. I exited to create my own consultancy in this field and moved 
        my family to SC. A year after striking out on my own things went downhill. Covid flattened the sources 
        of capital in that market and I found myself lost. I had always managed to sell my way out of a jam so I took 
        a job as a car salesperson. <em>This is where my life started to change for the positive during one 
        of its most challenging periods.</em></p><br>

        <p>It was during this time that the nagging knowledge that I had crippling gender dysphoria
        came to a head. With the support of my wife, I started privately taking hormone replacement 
        therapy for about six months of my year long stint selling various brands of cars in the south. 
        I managed to keep food on the table until it became too awkward for me to put on a suit every day 
        and pretend to be someone I wasn't. I quit and began ubering around a college and small backwoods 
        suburbs near my town. Just when this started to feel dangerous as my outward appearance changed, 
        I began working remotely for the largest retail distributor in a niche hobby market. Once again my 
        sales background bailed me out. <em>However, as my personality and physical appearance finally began 
        to match who I was inside, I started to explore old passions and interests that were lost to the 
        dissociation of repressing who I was.</em></p>

        <h2>~Embarking on The Odin Project~</h2>
        <p><strong>After a year of exploring various programming language learning paths, I settled on Javascipt 
        and stumbled upon The Odin Project!</strong> I feel like the kid again that used to make geocities websites at
        the local public library with gifs from their favorite video games of the time. (i.e., Diablo, Doom, Mech Warrior, 
        Super Mario World, and Final Fantasy) This isn't the 90s anymore, but making this HTML blog is bringing me back. 
        <em>I hope to thoroughly complete The Odin Project within about a year's time.</em></p>
